# Paige.create({ bio: "
# I am a Junior Full-Stack Developer and recently completed my apprenticeship at Launch Academy, Inc, based in Boston, MA. Currently I am attending graduate school at the University of Missouri Kansas City, for a Masters of Music. While I am still an actively working classical singer, I am seeking a new challenge and would like to be a junior developer at a great company that is making a difference in the world! My past experience in music, as well as my experience in sales and management have made me eager for every challenge that comes my way, and I have found that so many of those skills are applicable and desired in the developer environment. On a personal note, I love adventure, and have an indomitable spirit!" })
